    "# 🔥 Project Title: Predicting Forest Fire Occurrence and Severity in Algeria\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Objective:\n",
    "To analyze and predict the occurrence and severity of forest fires in Algeria using meteorological and environmental data from the Algerian Forest Fires dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗂️ Dataset Overview:\n",
    "- **Name**: Algerian Forest Fires Processed Dataset\n",
    "- **Source**: [UCI Machine Learning](\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/547/algerian+forest+fires+dataset\") Repository or [Kaggle](\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshu432/algerian-forest-fires-cleaned-dataset/data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes**:\n",
